# Kanagawa color theme for R Studio

Based on the original colorscheme [rebelot/kanagawa.nvim](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) for neovim.

# *WIP*

## Customizing the colorscheme

Edit the file `kanagawa.rstheme` following the documentation from 
<https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/appearance.html>.

Because RStudio is basically a web browser, you can use the 'inspect element'
option to help figure out what setting goes to which object.

I also found this guide to be helpful:

## Using the colorscheme

In R Studio, navigate through the menus `Tools -> Global Options -> Appearance` 
then click the 'Add' button and find the file `kanagawa.rstheme` in your local files.
